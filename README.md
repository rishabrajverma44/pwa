A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** is a type of web application that provides a native app-like experience by leveraging modern web technologies. It offers offline capabilities, push notifications, and faster load times while remaining accessible via a browser.

### ðŸš€ **Key Features of PWA**
- **Offline Support**: Works without an internet connection using service workers.
- **Fast & Responsive**: Loads quickly, even on slow networks.
- **Installable**: Can be installed on a device without needing an app store.
- **Push Notifications**: Engages users with real-time updates.
- **Secure**: Served over HTTPS for enhanced security.
- **Background Sync**: Updates data in the background for better performance.

Would you like me to integrate PWA features into your existing README or create a separate one for a new project? ðŸš€
