      Toward a Farmer-Centric Approach to Training in Malawi
    </strong>
  </h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Introduction</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sustainable Intensification (SI) technologies have been increasingly
            promoted for small-holder farmers in Africa in recent years.
            Governments, NGOs, and research institutions, including CIMMYT, have
            recognized the value of SI in protecting the environment and
            increasing productivity leading to greater food security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the immense diversity of agro-ecological zones and
            cultures present on the African continent, SI technologies need to
            be adapted the local context where they are being promoted.
            Unfortunately, adaptive methodologies for helping extension staff
            and farmers sort through the many possible SI technologies are
            lacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            To this end, CIMMYT launched the innovative Space to Place (S2P)
            project to enable the promotion of locally appropriate management
            recommendations, guided by a mobile phone application using
            digitized maps and farmer-level characteristics. CIMMYT staff and
            Malawi stakeholders have prepared a list of around 25 potential SI
            technologies and rated their appropriateness to different
            agroecological zones and soil textures. Presumably these
            technologies will also be rated according to their appropriateness
            for different farmer socio-economic characteristics before being
            programmed into a phone app.
          </p>
          <p>
            One potential risk to developing such an app is that it could be
            used by extension agents as a prescriptive tool. Given the lure of
            technological devices, they may assume that the app itself is
            sufficient to decide which technologies are appropriate for each
            context where they work. The pitfalls to such an approach include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A database of this sort can't possibly take into account the
              micro-level agroecological and socioeconomic diversity present in
              rural African communities.
            </li>
            <li>
              The farmers themselves don't participate in deciding which
              technologies they will learn about. As a result, the likelihood
              that they will actually adopt the technologies is much lower than
              if they had chosen what they wanted to learn.
            </li>
            <li>
              Local farmer knowledge and innovation doesn't contribute to the
              process. Inovative farmers in most communities have developed
              effective farming methods that can contribute to the productivity
              and sustainability of their neighbors as well as helping extension
              and research professionals broaden their list of approapriate
              technologies.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>
              <em>
                A farmer-centric approach to SI training will build on the
                strength of modern technology, while at the same time
                incorporating the interests and expertise of local farmers
              </em>
            </strong>
            . The phone app, currently under development, will help extension
            agents narrow down the roughtly 25 SI technologies to 3-4 best-bet
            options for each individual context. Then, though a participatory
            process, farmers themselves will add to this list and decide what
            new techniques they want the extension service to help them learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A Participatory Decision-Making Tool</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Key to the success of a farmer-centric approach is an effective
            decision-making tool that extension agents and lead farmers can use
            to facilitate the process of identifying technologies for training.
            An example of such a tool was developed by Partners of the Canadian
            Foodgrains Bank (CFGB) and shared with CIMMYT staff in June
            (Appendix 1). With some minor adaptation, this tool could be used as
            the first step in engaging a farmer group with the S2P approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool assumes the extension agent or lead farmer has the
            facilitation skills to lead a non-directive process and is committed
            to using a participary approach. Using it effectively will require
            training of the trainers, many of whom may be more comfortable with
            a more one-way delivery of extension information. Nevertheless,
            without a farmer-participatory process, the appropriateness of the
            selected technologies to each context, and the adoption rate of the
            farmers will be much lower.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pedigogical Approach: Dialogical vs. Didactic?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a farmer-group decides which innovations they want to learn and
            adopt, the extensionist or lead farmer will walk them through a
            learning process. The current Soil Health Manual, designed to train
            farmers on the roughly 25 SI technologies under consideration, uses
            a relatively traditional, didactic approach to training.
            Step-by-step guidance is given on how to implement each technology.
            Questions are presented at the end of each module for the sake of
            repeating information provided earlier in the lesson and assessing
            the comprehension of the learner, but farmers are not asked to
            provide their own ideas or suggestions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brazilian educator, Paulo Friere called this the 'banking' approach
            to education. Teachers with knowledge 'deposit' what they have into
            the knowledge bank of their students. Friere espoused an alternative
            approach in which a facilitator guides the learning process by
            posing open-ended, generative questions which invite learners to
            discuss and contribute to the learning process. Since 2015, CFGB
            staff and Partners have used this approach in promoting conservation
            agriculture throughout sub-Saharan Africa. A set of core CA training
            modules, and modules usng this approach for many other subjects, are
            available in many languages from the
            <a href="http://edn.link/farmertraining">ECHO website</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of these materials could be used directly or adapted to
            facilitate training for SI technologies in the S2P list. However, a
            prior question is whether we want to take a dialogical approach or a
            more traditional, didactic approach to training. A dialogical
            approach is clearly more farmer-centric. It capitalizes on farmer
            knowledge, combined with information from the scientific community,
            to identify solutions and build the commitment of farmers resulting
            in higher adoption rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, effective implementation of such an approach will
            call for significant training of trainers in order to be effective.
            CFGB has carried out a 'master training' process for NGO and
            government extension staff in Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Zimbabwe and
            Burundi which combines adult education/facilitation skills with
            technical training. Participants testify that the trainng has
            transformed their extension approach and helped them to engage
            farmers more effectively. In Ethiopia and Rwanda, the national
            extension services were impressed enough with the approach that they
            asked CFGB to train their extension staff throughout their
            countries. A private foundation (Ethiopia) and the World Food
            Program (Rwanda) have provided funding for these initiatives. Is
            there the potential for such an effort in the S2P countries?
          </p>
          <p>
            An alternative approach could be to incorporate some additional
            adult education principles (i.e. open-ended rather than leading
            questions, role plays, hands-on activities, etc.), but not expect
            extension personnel to gain the level of skills of a Master Trainer.
            This approach will be cheaper and quicker to implement, but likely
            less effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presumably the decision on pedigogical approach will be made in
            conversation with our extension partners in Malawi unless such a
            discussion has already taken place. I look forward to your guidance
            on how to proceed.

    <strong>
      1. Dig 4-5 liters of topsoil and place them in the bucket

    <strong>
      C. Allow each farmer to take a handful of each soil and examine them for
      several minutes</strong> (if the sun is hot, take the buckets to a shady spot before
      distributing samples and holding the following discussion):

      1. What differences have you seen between these two soils? Allow them to

  </p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      The soil from the regenerative field is darker (have them compare the 2
      colors to the Munsell Soil Color Chart on the poster).
    </li>
    <li>
      The soil from the regenerative field is softer and more crumbly.
    </li>
    <li>
      The soil from the regenerative field has more roots growing in it.
    </li>

    <strong>2. Which field has healthier-looking crops?</strong> If the field
    has already been harvested, ask them if they remember which field was more
    productive.

          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              She goes to the garden each day, works hard and brings food home
              to cook for them
            </li>
            <li>
              When she prepares their food, the children eat it all up and there
              is nothing left for her to eat.
            </li>
            <li>
              The children are very demanding and show no appreciation for the
              hard work their mother does on their behalf.
            </li>
          </ol>

            weaker.

          <ol type="a">
            <li>After some time she dies of hunger..</li>
            <li>
              The children cry and cry, but not because they love their mother,
              rather because now they have no one to take care of them!
            </li>
            <li>  In despiration, they consider themselves very unlucky.</li>

          <li>What should the children have done differently?</li>
          <li>
            What would you do if you had such greedy children in your family?
          </li>

                Allow the group to give their answers, but if they struggle,
                help them see that the earth provides for us and without it, we
                could not have life. In the Bible, God is said to have created
                human beings from dust!

          <li>
            What can we learn from the role play about caring for our Mother
            Earth?
          </li>
          <li>
            If we neglect to feed our Mother Earth, will we be able to survive
            ourselves?
          </li>
          <li>What are some of the ways we can feed our Mother Earth?</li>
