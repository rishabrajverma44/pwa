                Alternatively, it can be scheduled 2-3 months before the start
                of the rainy season as they develop their upcoming cropping

                nearby the homestead where people are living, or soils which are
                far away from the homestead? Why?

                The regenerative agriculture approach that we saw in the field

                    Performance in 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High' rainfall seasons /
                    years: Use this column to consider how each of the crop
                    practices will perform in rainfall scenarios.

                    Investment: Use this column to consider the level of
                    investment required for each practice. Is it high (H),
                    moderate (M) or low (L).

                    Time to benefit: Use this column to estimate how long it
                    will take before they start to benefit from each practice.
                    Make sure you take into account whether farmers would need
                    extra time to learn new skills or acquire materials.

                    Risks or disadvantages: Use this column to highlight any
                    other risks involved with the practices (e.g. less crop
                    residue for livestock feed if it is used for mulching).

                Go through the crop practices one by one, asking the farmers
                about each of the headings and agreeing on what should be filled
                in. It is important that the decisions are made by the group and
                not by you, the facilitator.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask the farmers to identify which practices are likely to be
                helpful in most seasons (whether they are low, medium or high
                rainfall seasons) or that will still give a reasonable yield in
                poor seasons. Mark these with a circle.
